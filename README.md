# Python IoT Device Simulator and Monitoring Dashboard  

This repository contains a **Python-based IoT device simulator** that emulates the behavior of a real-world device. It is designed to generate sensor data, perform basic analytics, and visualize results on a simple monitoring dashboard.  

The project demonstrates **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles and practical **data processing** techniques in Python.  

## ðŸ“Š Core Features and Components  

- **Sensor Class**  
  Simulates a real-world sensor, generating continuous data streams for analysis.  

- **DataProcessor Class**  
  Processes the simulated sensor data and performs basic analytics to extract insights.  

- **Communication Class**  
  Emulates data transmission to a central server, simulating IoT communication protocols.  

- **Device Class**  
  Integrates `Sensor`, `DataProcessor`, and `Communication` into a complete IoT device simulation.  

- **Monitoring Dashboard**  
  Visualizes collected sensor data and analytics results, providing a clear overview of device activity.
